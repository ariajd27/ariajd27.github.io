title: "Review: <i>With Her in Ourland</i> by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1915)"
---

The immediate continuation from where *Herland* lets off is much less popular than the original, and I think I understand why. This book is all polemics, largely without a plot, and Gilman's racism is put center-stage in numerous sections. Conditionally recommended.

## Concept

So, remember how Terry gets kicked out of Herland at the end of *Herland*? This is about what happens next: the adventures of Van, Ellador, and Terry (except he's not present very often) as they travel across our world. 

Basically, it's just Ellador discovering things about our world and reacting to them. It's much like *Herland*, except the focus this time is less on what utopia looks like than how our own world compares, and how to reach it.

Insofar as there is a plot at all, it's Van worrying about what Ellador will think of the United States. As he shows Ellador all the other nations of the world, he always makes that classic excuse: "Not all of us are like this! Just wait, you'll love America!" Of course, they eventually reach America, and it shouldn't be much of a spoiler to say that Ellador doesn't agree. So there's *technically* some conflict between Van and Ellador, but I'm not sure that that counts as a proper *plot*.

Also, this book came out in 1915, so it's set in 1915. The men aren't exactly happy about the situation they have to show Ellador around.

## Summary

I could have written a whole in-depth review about this, but I decided it didn't really make much sense. It's just *Herland*, but more of it. If you liked *Herland*, or you were interested in it, or you're studying it, you should read *With Her in Ourland*, too, because it's just a continuation of the same narrative. That's how Gilman seems to have intended it.

Review: If you got something out of *Herland*, pick this book up, too. Otherwise, don't bother.
