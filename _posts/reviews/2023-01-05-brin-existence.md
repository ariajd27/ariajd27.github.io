title: "Review: <i>Existence</i> by David Brin (2012)"
---

David Brin's last novel accepted for publication is a bizarre end to his career. An exceedingly strange interpretation of the alleged autism plague overshadows an interesting and quirky Fermi's Paradox solution. Conditionally recommended.

## Concept

The setting: Earth, vaguely near-future sort of setting. The Internet is key to everybody's lives, we all wear Google Glass analogues, the like. There's even this thing called a "smartmob" which basically amounts to "well, I don't know how to navigate this situation, but if it's interesting enough maybe I can just stream it and then do whatever Twitch chat says," and it seems... cool. The rich-poor divide has also heightened to the point that people now speak of, like, eleven different Estates, like it's the French Revolution but for some reason we've all decided that three Estates just isn't enough. Also there was a war over those popups that ask you to agree to cookies so now all information is always public and there is literally zero privacy in the world.

The incident: this neat sphere thing is discovered, which claims to be alien artifact bringing news from other civilizations about how to join the global community. After the first one is found, more and more turn up. Is it a hoax? It seems less and less likely.

Other stuff: Autistic people are actually Neanderthals --- the old genes were simply hidden in the *Homo sapiens sapiens* genome until it was "time" for them to reemerge. Dolphins were being uplifted --- because of course --- but in this particular Brin novel, the project ends up falling through. There are cyborgs, but not often.

## Positives

It's a great book on the Fermi paradox. Actually, the particular solution proposed in *Existence* doesn't seem to have made it onto the Wikipedia article or any listicles I could find, even now, over a decade after the book came out. That's probably because it's very quirky, but that doesn't make it not interesting. The book also includes many other short meditations on the Fermi paradox and the fundamental problems and contradictions threatening the core of human civilization.

Some of the characters and action scenes are interesting. Some.

## Negatives

Yeah, I've recommended this book to some people, but it's definitely not Brin's finest. I have a lot of minor problems with it, but one major one far outshadows the rest:

The autism nonsense manages to take up like 40% of the book, and it's completely clear that he's never talked to an autistic person before. Like, he's right: they aren't, *as he's written them*, human at all, they're weird aliens who sit around plotting weird terrorist attacks to punish... I don't think Brin actually understands what the high/low-functioning distinction is even supposed to be! And sure enough, his conclusion works that out: if I remember correctly, there end up being five species of humans sallying forth into the galaxy as one polity: humans, cyborgs, androids, high-functioning autistic people, and low-functioning autistic people. Oof.

## Conclusion

I only listed the one major negative because I feel like it's what's going to split you. If that sounds fine, read the book. If not, don't. I'd really mostly recommend this to somebody doing a "read every David Brin book" sort of thing (which was why I read it, actually) or somebody on a Fermi paradox kick. That's why this one is a conditional recommendation.

Short review this time --- I'll be doing more Brin books soon. Maybe *Remembrance of Earth's Past*, too, before it's entirely too late.
