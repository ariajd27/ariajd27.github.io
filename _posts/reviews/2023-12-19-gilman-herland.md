title: "Review: <i>Herland</i> by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1915)"
---

This classic feminist utopian novel is light on plot, heavy on polemics, and yet an untypically interesting story. It's still no thriller, of course, but it definitely makes sense that this is the one utopian novel of Gilman's that people often read. It's also probably the book in which Gilman's racist and eugenicist ideas are the least obvious. Conditionally recommended.

## Concept

Three American explorers --- Van, Jeff, and Terry --- set off to explore an uncharted territory that local lore holds is inhabited entirely by women. Doubtful that such a thing is possible, the three are nonetheless intrigued by the relatively-advanced technology and refined civilization they expect to find. Flying in by biplane, they reach Herland, and slowly come to terms with what they would never have thought possible, just as the women of Herland learn from them.

## Positives

This is a classic piece of feminist literature, and many of the points it makes are still relevant today. For example, as Gilman points out, isn't it strange that problems mostly perpetrated by women we attribute to women, while problems mostly perpetrated by men we call "human nature" and attribute to everybody? If you want a whole book of that, then *Herland* might be that book.

The three characters are standard archetypes that are commonly used in modern discourse and might even make a good basis for a simple Tripartite Classification of Men. Terry is a womanizer and a playboy, who is interested in Herland largely because he heard "land of women" and thought "I'm gonna get laid!" His complete lack of respect for Herland's customs and traditions, not to mention its people, gets him into continuous trouble. Jeff, on the other hand, is a simp, the stereotype of a male feminist who basically just agrees with everything the women says, seemingly in the hopes of getting laid. Van, our main character, is somewhere in between: he sees himself as a rational moderate, a sane sociologist here to cooly evaluate the situation and deal with Herland as none other present can. Well, other than when he's trying to get laid, anyway.

The story of the men's capture, imprisonment, escape, et cetera is also not entirely uninteresting. This has all the hallmarks and story beats of a good first contact story, so if that's what you're intersted in, I wouldn't tell you *not* to read this.

## Negatives

Gilman was pretty racist and eugenicist, and even if this is the book in which it shows through the least, it still shows through. You can see many basic themes from her works --- discrete peoples may be categorized by their levels of civilization, uncivilized, primitive savages are worthless, a good culture would cultivate good race traits, a good society should prevent its unworthy members from reproducing --- in *Herland*. If you want to read one of her books, this is the one, but I'd totally understand not wanting to read any.

Herland also hasn't exactly solved sexism; modern understandings of sexism --- and for that matter, some contemporary to Gilman as well --- differ significantly to Gilman's. For example, Herland is structured entirely around reproduction, with motherhood as the ultimate ideal and refusal of procreation the ultimate punishment. But of course, reducing women to their capacity as mothers is... not exactly a progressive idea these days. Gilman is generally very bioessentialist in her diagnoses of problems, as well. If she were around today, it seems like she'd be more on the "men are all fundamentally rapists" side of things than on the "better education and a shift in cultural attitudes could reduce the harm done by rape" side.

## Summary

If you want modern, intersectional feminism, *Herland* is not your book. If you want a clever plot that leaves you guessing at every turn, *Herland* is not your book. If you want a gripping first contact story, *Herland* is probably not your book. But if you want a look at a first-wave feminist utopia, or if you have read or plan to read David Brin's *Glory Season* (which I'll write about soon), read *Herland* --- there's probably *something* in there you'll find interesting.
