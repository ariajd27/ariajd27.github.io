title: "Review: <i>Anathem</i> by Neil Stephenson (2008)"
---

Neil Stephenson's greatest novel is a triumph of imagination, with a compelling and rich world, skillful pacing and foreshadowing, and a likeable cast of characters. Science, religion, and magic are skillfully blended through interesting dialogue and intriguing items. The complex plot is well-worth-it to those who don't have a problem with Stephenson's verbose style. Highly recommended.

By the way, there are a lot of made-up words in this book. In this review, they will be in *italics*. That's a lot of italics.

# Concept

*In Erasmus' world,* the terrors of science (also known as *praxis*) demonstrated in a long-ago war have led to a commitment to separate the *praxic* and *theoric* into the secular and *mathic* worlds respectively. Scientists, philosophers, mathematicians, and the like --- the *avout* --- all live in monastery-analogues called *maths*. Making a commitment to a *math* sees one live there for a set term of one, ten, one hundred, or one thousand years, though one does not simply *become* a *Milennarian*.

Our hero, *Fraa* Erasmus, a *Decenarian* of the *Concent* of *Saunt* Edhar, is in the usual position for a protagonist of the genre: he's curious, he knows somebody who's in the thick of it, and he's managed to stumble his way into the middle of a drama he can't possibly hope to comprehend the scope of. His journey will see him go further than he could ever imagine, learn things that he couldn't believe, and meet powers that he can't understand.

# Positives

This is actually one of my favorite books of all time. The plot is compelling, the science is interesting, but above all else, the worldbuilding is genuinely really, really interesting! It's just strange enough to be alien, but in writing so, Stephenson makes a world that's both very easy to imagine and also very rewarding to explore. If you like worldbuilding, then this is a good book for you.

Science and math take center stage as well, with several *actual proofs* included in the novel, though broken out into appendices in case you want to skip over the details (and pictures). That said, I feel that the primary purpose of all the technical mumbo jumbo is effectively turned into just another way of fleshing out *mathic* culture, and makes it feel remarkably complete.

And if you liked the final scene of *2001*, just wait for the final scene of *Anathem*!

# Negatives

It's a Neil Stephenson book. It's long, there's a lot of description, and the plot is somewhat convoluted. Some aspects of the worldbuilding are clearly just jabs at our world. And (on the face of it, anyway) some worldbuilding elements may seem... *remarkably derivative*.

Also, because I don't want to leave it out: Stephenson writes women in a way that isn't distinctly terrible, but there are still a few painful points here and there, especially to do with the protagonist's love interest. It's better than Tekla in *Seveneves*, but it's not incredible. For what it's worth, though, I don't think anybody would find this aspect of the book disqualifying, and encourage you to read it anyway.

# Summary

This book is great. Like I said, it's one of my favorites. It might not be for everybody, but I'm still going to say it: pick it up, and see if you like it!
