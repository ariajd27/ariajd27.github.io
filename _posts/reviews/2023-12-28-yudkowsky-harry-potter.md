title: "Review: <i>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</i> by Eliezer Yudkowsky (2015)"
---

AI-fearing tech bro writes surprisingly good abridging of *Harry Potter* that can be both clever and funny. Narrative elements from the original are skilfully rearranged into a more interesting new work. Educational sections and references will not appeal to everybody. Conditionally recommended.

Why did I read this?

I promise I'll avoid doing too many fanfic reviews, but you know what, I read this, so I'm writing about it. Somebody mentioned it to me years ago, and I heard about it again recently, so I was like, "you know what? Yeah, I'm in the mood for some *Harry Potter* fanfic." And I'm not even sure I regret it!

## Concept

Basically, Yudkowsky (under the pseudonym "LessWrong") rewrites *Harry Potter* around three basic principles:

1. Harry is now the son of two academics and has always been very into STEM, so he's more of an experimentalist and also generally more smart about everything that he does.

2. Magic works in more consistent ways, and with a couple of restrictions that the original might have been improved by the inclusion of (like "you can't ever travel back in time more than six hours," which would answer 99% of complaints about time-turners).

3. The Wizarding World's politics and history are more fleshed out, so the story can interact a lot more with politics and systemic issues than the original.

Also, the series is properly abridged. Elements from all seven books are rearranged and redesigned into a work the length of one, characters are reinterpreted or completely recharacterized, and many parts of the fic reference events in or elements of the original series. I think that *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* could certainly be enjoyed by somebody who has not ever read *Harry Potter*; however, I think that that's not the intended audience and that it would only be fully appreciated by somebody familiar with the source material.

The fic can be read [online](https://hpmor.com/), coming in at 122 chapters, or it can (apparently) be downloaded as several PDFs, which I guess makes this actually a series of several very short novellas. Would they be light novels? Let's hope I don't review too many more things in this format for this blog.

## Positives

If you like discovery stories, and you like *Harry Potter*, then I think this fic can scratch that itch. Yudkowsky's elaborations on the original mechanics established in Rowling's books make a really interesting backdrop in which to delve deeper into much of the setting and dynamics and answer a lot of questions left open by Rowling. In that sense, I'd recommend it as a good fanfic, to fans.

Harry discovering things, giving straight man reactions to them, arguing with them, and then exploiting them can be quite funny. *I* certainly got a lot of laughs out of this fic! So if you actually don't like *Harry Potter* much, or especially if you were nodding or giggling along with [that one Shaun video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1iaJWSwUZs) for its full runtime, then this is a great fic to laugh along with you at the original. This was definitely one of the big positives for me.

## Negatives

It's fanfic written by a nerdy tech bro type, and that's the source of most of the issues I can see with this story. There are a smattering of anime references (none of which I got, actually), the main character will be most relatable to unlikable middle- and high-schoolers, and the treatment of the female lead (Hermione Granger, of course) felt pretty strange at times. She consistently fights for her right to determine her own life and stand on her own merits without just being Harry's sidekick or rival, which is an interesting arc, but I'm just not sure about how well it was done. In other words, if you liked *Sword Art Online Abridged*, and you like science and big-brain plots, you'll like this. If you don't know what that is and resent me for making an anime reference, you probably won't. Otherwise, I don't know.

There's a pretty strong shift in tone and focus throughout the fic, as well. The beginning of the story sees Harry spend a lot of time explaining his thought processes, performing experiments on all of his magical items and with all of his spells, investigating and pointing out issues with the Wizarding World, and so on. By the midpoint of the story, though, this is pretty much all gone, never to return; a significantly less intelligent-seeming Harry spends most of his time instead on politics, drama, confronting his inner demons, and not noticing the really obvious reveal at the end of the story. Therefore, I wouldn't really be surprised if there are readers who get through a few dozen chapters and then just lose interest and quit.

Last, Yudkowsky incorporates a lot of... well, let's say *avant-garde* scientific ideas into the fic. A "timeless physics," for example, is not only mentioned but manages to be a key asset of Harry's--- what is it though? I'm still not sure. Yudkowsky notes that it's not a fleshed-out theory yet, and that's easily verified, but he doesn't even really bother to try to explain it, and literature about it isn't easily available online. If it's actually plenty available and I'm just not able to understand it at all, then I have a bone to pick with Harry, who apparently comprehends it completely and fundamentally, because that's not "I'm pretty smart for an eleven-year-old"-level physics. I was pretty smart as an eleven-year-old. Seriously, who is this guy? Ayanokouji Kiyotaka? Generally, though, if the fic is being used for its apparently intended purpose --- that is, scientific education and as a rationalist propaganda piece --- then it might be failing somewhat just due to scientific inaccuracy. Take it with a tablespoon of salt, at least for now.

## Summary

I don't know who I'd recommend this to--- well, what category, anyway. There are a few specific people in my own life who I know would like *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*, but as for the overall *category* of people that it'd be good for, I'm really not sure. People who were kind of nerdy loners growing up might like this version of Harry, or maybe a certain autistic stereotype; people who want to learn about cognitive bias and rationality seem to be Yudkowsky's target audience, but I'm not really sure this is the best way to do so; and I was mostly just interested by it as a rewrite of the *Harry Potter* series and wanted to see what Yudkowsky could make of the setting.

I'm calling that a conditional recommendation, but I'm uniquely unsure of what the condition actually is. Fortunately, the story is free-to-read, and it offers its own solution to this issue: just start reading it, and if you're not into it by chapter 5 or so, put it down and move on. I guess that's my recommendation, too.
