Narrative elements from the original are skilfully rearranged into a more interesting new work. Educational sections and references will not appeal to everybody. Conditionally recommended.</p>

<p>Why did I read this?</p>

<p>I promise I’ll avoid doing too many fanfic reviews, but you know what, I read this, so I’m writing about it. Somebody mentioned it to me years ago, and I heard about it again recently, so I was like, “you know what? Yeah, I’m in the mood for some <em>Harry Potter</em> fanfic.” And I’m not even sure I regret it!</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>Basically, Yudkowsky (under the pseudonym “LessWrong”) rewrites <em>Harry Potter</em> around three basic principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Harry is now the son of two academics and has always been very into STEM, so he’s more of an experimentalist and also generally more smart about everything that he does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Magic works in more consistent ways, and with a couple of restrictions that the original might have been improved by the inclusion of (like “you can’t ever travel back in time more than six hours,” which would answer 99% of complaints about time-turners).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Wizarding World’s politics and history are more fleshed out, so the story can interact a lot more with politics and systemic issues than the original.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Also, the series is properly abridged. Elements from all seven books are rearranged and redesigned into a work the length of one, characters are reinterpreted or completely recharacterized, and many parts of the fic reference events in or elements of the original series. I think that <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em> could certainly be enjoyed by somebody who has not ever read <em>Harry Potter</em>; however, I think that that’s not the intended audience and that it would only be fully appreciated by somebody familiar with the source material.</p>

<p>The fic can be read <a href="https://hpmor.com/">online</a>, coming in at 122 chapters, or it can (apparently) be downloaded as several PDFs, which I guess makes this actually a series of several very short novellas. Would they be light novels? Let’s hope I don’t review too many more things in this format for this blog.</p>

<h2 id="positives">Positives</h2>

<p>If you like discovery stories, and you like <em>Harry Potter</em>, then I think this fic can scratch that itch. Yudkowsky’s elaborations on the original mechanics established in Rowling’s books make a really interesting backdrop in which to delve deeper into much of the setting and dynamics and answer a lot of questions left open by Rowling. In that sense, I’d recommend it as a good fanfic, to fans.</p>

<p>Harry discovering things, giving straight man reactions to them, arguing with them, and then exploiting them can be quite funny. <em>I</em> certainly got a lot of laughs out of this fic! So if you actually don’t like <em>Harry Potter</em> much, or especially if you were nodding or giggling along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1iaJWSwUZs">that one Shaun video</a> for its full runtime, then this is a great fic to laugh along with you at the original. This was definitely one of the big positives for me.</p>

<h2 id="negatives">Negatives</h2>

<p>It’s fanfic written by a nerdy tech bro type, and that’s the source of most of the issues I can see with this story. There are a smattering of anime references (none of which I got, actually), the main character will be most relatable to unlikable middle- and high-schoolers, and the treatment of the female lead (Hermione Granger, of course) felt pretty strange at times. She consistently fights for her right to determine her own life and stand on her own merits without just being Harry’s sidekick or rival, which is an interesting arc, but I’m just not sure about how well it was done. In other words, if you liked <em>Sword Art Online Abridged</em>, and you like science and big-brain plots, you’ll like this. If you don’t know what that is and resent me for making an anime reference, you probably won’t. Otherwise, I don’t know.</p>

<p>There’s a strange and gradual shift throughout the fic, as well. The beginning of the story sees Harry spend a lot of time explaining his thought processes, performing experiments on all of his magical items and with all of his spells, investigating and pointing out issues with the Wizarding World, and so on. By the midpoint of the story, though, this is pretty much all gone, never to return; Harry spends most of his time instead on politics, drama, confronting his inner demons, and not noticing the really obvious reveal at the end of the story. Therefore, I wouldn’t really be surprised if there are readers who get through a few dozen chapters and then just lose interest and quit.</p>

<p>Last, and maybe most importantly, Yudkowsky incorporates a lot of… well, let’s say <em>avant-garde</em> scientific ideas into the fic. A “timeless physics,” for example, is not only mentioned but manages to be a key asset of Harry’s— what is it though? I’m still not sure. Yudkowsky notes that it’s not a fleshed-out theory yet, and that’s easily verified, but he doesn’t even really bother to try to explain it, and literature about it isn’t easily available online. If it’s actually plenty available and I’m just not able to understand it at all, then I have a bone to pick with Harry, who apparently comprehends it completely and fundamentally, because that’s not “I’m pretty smart for an eleven-year-old”-level physics. I was pretty smart as an eleven-year-old. Seriously, who is this guy? Ayanokouji Kiyotaka? Generally, though, if the fic is being used for its apparently intended purpose — that is, scientific education and as a rationalist propaganda piece — then it might be failing somewhat just due to scientific inaccuracy. Take it with a tablespoon of salt, at least for now.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I don’t know who I’d recommend this to— well, what category, anyway. There are a few specific people in my own life who I know would like <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>, but as for the overall <em>category</em> of people that it’d be good for, I’m really not sure. People who were kind of nerdy loners growing up might like this version of Harry, or maybe a certain autistic stereotype; people who want to learn about cognitive bias and rationality seem to be Yudkowsky’s target audience, but I’m not really sure this is the best way to do so; and I was mostly just interested by it as a rewrite of the <em>Harry Potter</em> series and wanted to see what Yudkowsky could make of the setting.</p>

<p>I’m calling that a conditional recommendation, but I’m uniquely unsure of what the condition actually is. Fortunately, the story is free-to-read, and it offers its own solution to this issue: just start reading it, and if you’re not into it by chapter 5 or so, put it down and move on. I guess that’s my recommendation, too.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI-fearing tech bro writes surprisingly decent abridging of Harry Potter that is often more fanfic of Daniel Kahneman’s research than of the source material.

It’s still no thriller, of course, but it definitely makes sense that this is the one utopian novel of Gilman’s that people often read. It’s also probably the book in which Gilman’s racist and eugenicist ideas are the least obvious. Conditionally recommended.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>Three American explorers — Van, Jeff, and Terry — set off to explore an uncharted territory that local lore holds is inhabited entirely by women. Doubtful that such a thing is possible, the three are nonetheless intrigued by the relatively-advanced technology and refined civilization they expect to find. Flying in by biplane, they reach Herland, and slowly come to terms with what they would never have thought possible, just as the women of Herland learn from them.</p>

<h2 id="positives">Positives</h2>

<p>This is a classic piece of feminist literature, and many of the points it makes are still relevant today. For example, as Gilman points out, isn’t it strange that problems mostly perpetrated by women we attribute to women, while problems mostly perpetrated by men we call “human nature” and attribute to everybody? If you want a whole book of that, then <em>Herland</em> might be that book.</p>

<p>The three characters are standard archetypes that are commonly used in modern discourse and might even make a good basis for a simple Tripartite Classification of Men. Terry is a womanizer and a playboy, who is interested in Herland largely because he heard “land of women” and thought “I’m gonna get laid!” His complete lack of respect for Herland’s customs and traditions, not to mention its people, gets him into continuous trouble. Jeff, on the other hand, is a simp, the stereotype of a male feminist who basically just agrees with everything the women says, seemingly in the hopes of getting laid. Van, our main character, is somewhere in between: he sees himself as a rational moderate, a sane sociologist here to cooly evaluate the situation and deal with Herland as none other present can. Well, other than when he’s trying to get laid, anyway.</p>

<p>The story of the men’s capture, imprisonment, escape, et cetera is also not entirely uninteresting. This has all the hallmarks and story beats of a good first contact story, so if that’s what you’re intersted in, I wouldn’t tell you <em>not</em> to read this.</p>

<h2 id="negatives">Negatives</h2>

<p>Gilman was pretty racist and eugenicist, and even if this is the book in which it shows through the least, it still shows through. You can see many basic themes from her works — discrete peoples may be categorized by their levels of civilization, uncivilized, primitive savages are worthless, a good culture would cultivate good race traits, a good society should prevent its unworthy members from reproducing — in <em>Herland</em>. If you want to read one of her books, this is the one, but I’d totally understand not wanting to read any.</p>

<p>Herland also hasn’t exactly solved sexism; modern understandings of sexism — and for that matter, some contemporary to Gilman as well — differ significantly to Gilman’s. For example, Herland is structured entirely around reproduction, with motherhood as the ultimate ideal and refusal of procreation the ultimate punishment. But of course, reducing women to their capacity as mothers is… not exactly a progressive idea these days. Gilman is generally very bioessentialist in her diagnoses of problems, as well. If she were around today, it seems like she’d be more on the “men are all fundamentally rapists” side of things than on the “better education and a shift in cultural attitudes could reduce the harm done by rape” side.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>If you want modern, intersectional feminism, <em>Herland</em> is not your book. If you want a clever plot that leaves you guessing at every turn, <em>Herland</em> is not your book. If you want a gripping first contact story, <em>Herland</em> is probably not your book. But if you want a look at a first-wave feminist utopia, or if you have read or plan to read David Brin’s <em>Glory Season</em> (which I’ll write about soon), read <em>Herland</em> — there’s probably <em>something</em> in there you’ll find interesting.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This classic feminist utopian novel is light on plot, heavy on polemics, and yet an untypically interesting story.

While <em>A Desolation Called Peace</em> is a touching romance and keeps some of the same political and character-driven charm of the first novel, the discovery story is lacking. Conditionally recommended.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>After diverting the Empire’s attention from Lsel Station by calling attention to a new alien threat from beyond the Anhemnemat Gate, the new Emperor Nineteen Adze sends new <em>yaotlek</em> Nine Hibiscus to confront the menace. Nine Hibiscus, struggling with her loyal friend and advisor Twenty Cicada to keep her subordinates in line and her fleet intact, calls for an <em>askreta</em> from the Information Ministry to assist her in her campaigns. Three Seagrass decides to send herself, picking up Ambassador Mahit Dzmare from Lsel Station as well in order to enlist her help in communicating with the aliens.</p>

<p>Mahit Dzmare’s return from Teixcalaan has not been good for her. Realizing that she and Yskandr essentially sold Lsel Station’s secret technology, Heritage Councilor Akhel Amnardbat is determined to see her gone and her imago discarded, and none of the other councilors seem interested in protecting her. She therefore takes Three Seagrass up on the offer and returns to serve the Empire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Teixcalaan itself, Six Direction’s son and heir to Nineteen Adze, Eight Antidote, is learning more and more not only about warfare and administration but about the war unfolding beyond the Anhemnemat Gate. He’s got questions, and the ministers’ answers only seem to give him more. But what can some kid under the thumb of the Empire do, anyway?</p>

<h2 id="positives">Positives</h2>

<p>The relationship between Three Seagrass and Mahit Dzmare is oddly compelling. It’s very rare that I feel about a romance in a science fiction story anything other than “ugh, when will this be done so that we can get back to the interesting stuff?” Despite that, Martine manages to write something that has me consistently invested and desperately pleading for the two to reconcile, solve their problems, and end up together.</p>

<p>Eight Antidote ends up being a pivotal character in the story, which I like. Science fiction doesn’t completely lack children solving problems where adults were blind, but his plotting manages to simultaneously be clever, critical, and still childish.</p>

<p>The eventual way that Mahit escapes her persecution on Lsel is interesting — actually, overall, I’d say that her relationship with Lsel Station and Three Seagrass and the way love, loyalty, and nationality are intertwined with each is the real gold in this story. My problems with this book pretty much all stem from the fact that other things distracted me from what could have also just been a neat if rather mysterious short story about Mahit and Three Seagrass on Nine Hibiscus’s flagship investigating a vague and never-really-specified situation, where the story remains just about the spotlight characters and the way that nation, culture, and empire influence their motivations and relationships.</p>

<h2 id="negatives">Negatives</h2>

<p>There is no mystery in this story! The original had a deep web of plots that the reader needed to wade through with Mahit and Yskandr, trying to figure out the motivations and histories of all the other characters just as they did. <em>A Desolation Called Peace</em>, on the other hand, spoils itself: the very first thing in the book you read is from the perspective of the aliens, clearly demonstrating that are a hive mind — something that the book then acts, for the entire rest of its first half, as though it is some kind of clever secret to be figured out! The “Shard trick” that Nine Hibiscus and her subordinates are so cagey and mysterious about is similarly obvious, <em>especially</em> once the hive mind theme has already been so bluntly established. As a result, I was very frustrated reading a lot of the first contact bits, because it really just felt like I had nothing to do but wait for the charcters to realize the most obvious facts of their situation. The story might work a little better as written for readers not as familiar with the hive mind as a science fiction concept, but as it is, Martine seems to have commited the critical error of simulatenously revealing something and writing a story that depended on it not having been revealed.</p>

<p>Message-wise, “don’t genocide your enemies” is never going to go over too poorly with me. Theme-wise, though, I’m not so sure about this book. It takes a core similarity between Teixcalaanli and Stationer culture and decides to throw it aside in favor of an exploration of collective consciousness that really feels more like “Martine thought this seemed interesting” than “Martine has something interesting to say.” Like, what do I take away from the novel <em>about</em> collective consciousness? I’m not sure it really adds anything to the conversation.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This was a bit of a mixed bag: there were many points at which I was keenly invested in everything that was happening, but there were also many sections that I found purely frustrating to get through. Therefore, I would recommend this book only to fans of <em>A Memory Called Empire</em> who are desperately waiting to see what happens next in the world of Teixcalaan and Lsel Station. Read it for more of Martine’s insight into culture, but if you’re interested in the advertized first contact story, then I’d say to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for reading this. If you think I’ve been unfair, don’t hesitate to reach out and let me know your own thoughts — I’d love to hear them. Have a good day!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequel to A Memory Called Empire sees Martine struggle to center a well-worn science fiction trope without significant new ideas.

Full of political intrigue, enticing flavor, compelling characters, and well-developed relationships, this book is excellent despite minor issues mostly related to language. Highly recommended.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>Mahit Dzmare of Lsel Station has always been obsesssed with Teixcalaanli culture. She had read all about Teixcalaan, studied its language and customs, taken classes, and even — once, as an exercise — come up with a Teixcalaanli name. Naturally, then, when Lsel needs a new Ambassador to Teixcalaan, Mahit is the natural choice.</p>

<p>The main complications from her job all stem, more or less, from a technology omnipresent in and central to Stationer society: the imago machine. Stationers have snapshots taken from their lives and stored in imago machines, which their successors have surgically installed to gain their lives’ skills, experiences, and memories. This is kept strictly as a state secret from the Empire, but has been a key part of Stationer social structure for as long as its people can remember. The imago’s personality is also preserved, and for the period between the initial surgery and full integration, acts as a distinct voice-in-the-head type of presence for the host.</p>

<p>Mahit arrives in Teixcalaan to find her predecessor, Yskandr Aghavn, dead, and a shady investigation into why already underway. Her main ambassadorial duty — preventing Teixcalaan from invading Stationer space — more difficult than expected. Cultural shock hits quickly, even for a Teixcaboo like Mahit. And every time she tries to solve a problem, all she finds is more schemes and plots…</p>

<h2 id="positives">Positives</h2>

<p>I loved the intrigue, scheming, politics, and even poetry. Martine does a very good job of making it feel like Mahit really has walked right into an already-twisted web full of characters in conflict, and it gives the plot the perfect balance between crazy plot twists and “oh, so <em>that’s</em> what’s going on!” that made me feel rather smart at times as I was reading it.</p>

<p>The pacing was excellent: no chapters felt like drags, but it was also very rare that I wished any scene had been made much longer. The story starts slow, then accelerates, building more and more tension until all hell breaks loose — just what’s expected of the genre. By the end, I couldn’t stop reading the book. Well, actually, the whole thing was so gripping that I went through it all in one plane ride to Detroit.</p>

<p>I’d like to call special attention to the names Martine uses for Teixcalaanli characters. Each Teixcalaanlitzim has a name composed of a cardinal number and a thing, almost always a type of plant, something else from nature, or a cool science fiction word; examples include “Three Seagrass”, “One Lightning”, and “Nineteen Adze”. Wait, an adze? Yes, the theming is fairly loose, but I think having just a <em>general</em> trend towards plants and nature gives a lot to establish a poetic theme for Teixcalaanli society while also giving room for individual Teixcalaanlitzim to have names that stand out. Some readers of the book seem to struggle with keeping these names straight, which I can imagine, but I never had any problem with this myself… I guess that’s something that should be kept in mind, though.</p>

<p>It’s also interesting to me the way that Martine has set up Teixcalaan and Lsel Station as seeming very different and being constantly at odds — culturally, anyway — while really having very similar core values. Stationers may do through technology what Teixcalaanlitzim do through literature, but in the end, both societies are built around constantly emulating and even reliving the past. I’ll avoid going into some kind of deep analysis of the novel, but I do feel that <em>A Memory Called Empire</em> is symbolically rich enough to appeal to that kind of reader as well.</p>

<h2 id="negatives">Negatives</h2>

<p>The linguistics of Teixcalaanli are a bit strange. First off, the story stresses — numerous times, actually — that Teixcalaanlitzim have only one word for “the world” (all that exists), “the Empire” (of Teixcalaan), “the Planet” (of Teixcalaan), and “the City” (because the Planet Teixcalaan is, of course, an ecumenopolis). I just don’t really know how to feel about this. Having only one word for the Planet and the City makes sense, because they are basically the same thing. Having only one word for the Empire and the Planet is a little less natural, but it still feels to me both realistic and cool: after all, it’s how we talk about Rome. But talking about all things that exist as being the same thing as the Empire — to the extent that things outside the Empire are “outside of the world” — makes zero sense. Like, the military of Teixcalaan fights on the border and even conquers other planets. They have ambassadors. I understand that they have that imperialist mindset of “Lsel is only independent because we let them be, but we would be totally in the right to take them over,” but like, they are capable of recognizing and contrasting against the Empire things that lie outside of its administrative or military reach. Does the average Teixcalaanlitzim simply not acknowledge that alien threats exist? If so, that’s crazy. Otherwise, there must be some other word — besides “Teixcalaan”, I mean — that actually refers to things that exist but aren’t in the Empire. Right?</p>

<p>The other thing is that I don’t really know how I’m supposed to pronounce Teixcalaanli words because the pronunciation guide is clearly messed up (in both this book and its sequel, <em>A Desolation Called Peace</em>). Here are just three examples of the inconsistencies I notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt;aa&gt; is supposed to extend the length of the sound represented by &lt;a&gt; without changing its quality, and yet the IPA given has two different vowel qualities and the same lengths for each.</li>
  <li>&lt;l&gt;, according to the given IPA, apparently represents a voiced velar fricative (in most environments). You know, as in the words “bell” and “ball”. The only problem is that that’s not a voiced velar fricative, it’s a velarized alveolar lateral approximant, the IPA transcription of which shares a symbol (kinda) but is absolutely not the same.</li>
  <li>The IPA given for &lt;r&gt; conflicts with the American English examples because the rhotic in American English is definitely not an alveolar flap.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, I’m not criticizing the book for being unrealistic. I just wish Martine had managed to describe Teixcalaanli phonetics in a more consistent way so that I were more confident in how words like “Teixclaanli” are actually supposed to be pronounced! Is this a nitpicky complaint? Yeah… but…</p>

<p>Maybe the fact that these are the big issues I can come up with means that the book is actually really good?</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Yeah, those are the harshest negatives I could really think of. Everything else really was just little personal-taste stuff that (at least for now) I’m going to try to avoid on this blog. The action was gripping, the intrigue compelling, and the worldbuilding impressive. Despite that, it still manages to strike that perfect balance of having a world that serves the plot and themes well without taking over the story and leading the narrator into description hell, never to escape. This book is not only my first review on the blog, but also my first recommendation, and I would recommend it to the broadest audience possible.</p>
