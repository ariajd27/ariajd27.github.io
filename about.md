# About Me

Hello there!

My name is Aliya, and I'm an undergraduate student in linguistics in the United States. I've been a fan of science fiction and fantasy since I first started reading; about the first book-related memory I have is of my father reading me *The Hobbit*. Once I could read for myself, I didn't stop! I read mostly Alastair Reynolds, David Brin, and Neil Stephenson, and I continue to read at least a book or two every month to this day.

Does that make me qualified to review and recommend books? I'll be the first to admit that I haven't seen everything, and I am quite young yet. Then again, everybody has a lot of books that they haven't read, and who knows? Maybe youth instead gives me a fresh and unique perspective. If all you do is read one of my recommendations, I'll be happy having shared a book I loved with somebody else.

In case you're interested, here are just a few of my preferences:

- When reading and in my reviews, I'm often a lot less concerned with plots and characters than with compelling themes, statements, messages, ideas, and settings. As a result, some of my judgements may seem rather strange. For example, David Brin's *Glory Season* is one of my favorite books of all time, despite the fact that its plot mainly consists of the protagonist getting knocked out about fourteen times.
- I do certainly appreciate crazy plot twist gimmicks! Reynolds' *Chasm City* and frankly even James P. Hogan's *Inherit the Stars* also rank up there.
- After reading books like Stephenson's *Anathem* and Walter M. Miller Jr.'s *A Canticle for Leibowitz*, I'm always on the lookout for more space monks! In general, if a work manages to blend science fiction, religion, fantasy, and general strangeness in an at-all elegant way, I'll be unlikely not to recommend it in some way.
- I'm not a big Asimov fan. Yeah, I know. Look, everybody's different, okay?

Anyway, thanks for reading this, and I hope you find something you like!

Aliya
