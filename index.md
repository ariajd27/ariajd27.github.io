Welcome!

This is *The Extent of the World*, a book blog with a focus on science fiction and adjacent genres. I'm a big fan of speculative fiction and the ways that authors can give us windows into possible futures and illuminate strange ideas, and I'd love to share some of my favorite books with you!

I write both straightforward book reviews and the occasional longer essay, usually about the relationships between some set of books, my overall thoughts on some specific author, or science fiction in general. Hopefully, there's something you'll find interesting here.

Here are some of my most recent posts:
