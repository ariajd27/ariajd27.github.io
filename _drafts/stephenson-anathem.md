title: "Review: <i>Anathem</i> by Neil Stephenson (2008)"
---

Neil Stephenson's greatest novel is a triumph of imagination, with a compelling and rich world, skillful pacing and foreshadowing, and a likeable cast of characters. Science, religion, and magic are skillfully blended through interesting dialogue and intriguing items. The complex plot is well-worth-it to those who don't have a problem with Stephenson's verbose style. Highly recommended.
