title: "Review: <i>Semiosis</i> by Sue Burke (2018)"
---

Sue Burke's debut novel replaces a standard first contact timeline with a more modern intergenerational saga. Her interest in biochemistry is plainly evident throughout the novel, which manages to strike a variety of tones throughout. Other than several dark episodes, *Semiosis* manages to stay rather light and even humorous. Recommended.
