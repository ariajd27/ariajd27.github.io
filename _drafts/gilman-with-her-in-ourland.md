title: "Review: <i>With Her in Ourland</i> by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1915)"
---

The immediate continuation from where *Herland* lets off is much less popular than the original, and I think I understand why. This book is all polemics, largely without a plot, and Gilman's racism is put center-stage in numerous sections. Conditionally recommended.
