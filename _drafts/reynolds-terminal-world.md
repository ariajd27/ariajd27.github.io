title: "Review: <i>Terminal World</i> by Alastair Reynolds (2010)"
---

An underappreciated foray into steampunk by Alastair Reynolds belies a hauntingly mutilated cosmos and a cleverly hidden twist. *Terminal World* rewards readers' interest in its setting and history, though it is easily spoiled. The plot's conclusion is considered unsatisfying by many, and Reynolds does not plan to ever continue it. Recommended.
